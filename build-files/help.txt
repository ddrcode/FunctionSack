Usage: jake COMMAND OPTIONS

The file provides several options for building the output file based on input
js. All output files will be saved in 'build' directory. Build system does not
warn about overriding. See 'config.json' file to change standard configuration 
options.  

COMMANDS:
   help                      displays this help and exit
   buildall [file]           builds all modules to file specified by file option
                             If option not provided file name will be taken from
                             config.json file.
   build file mod1 [mod2]    build a file with given modules. It does not check
                             dependencies between modules! Any number of modules
                             can be passed. File name doesn't have to have an
                             extension (.js)
   buildmod mod1 [mod2]      build module(s) to separate files. This option 
                             considers dependencies (see examples below).
   modules                   displays available module names
   dependencies              displays modules and dependencies between them
   
EXAMPLES:
jake buildall - creates complete build file
jake build fns-obj-full core type obj - creates fns-obj-full.js file from 
                             modules 'core', 'type' and 'obj'
jake buildmod obj type       creates two files: a) 'fns-obj-full.js' from 
                             modules 'obj', 'type' and 'es5' (due to the depen-
                             dencies declared in config.json file).
                             b) 'fns-type-full.js' file from 'type' module
                             (no additional dependencies declared)
